# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

For this project I have build a day planner to where a user can store input for daily tasks in a 9 to 5 work day. When the input is save it is store in local storage and can be recalled if the string is refreshed our closed. The hours change color based on the time of day to show whether that time block is in the past, present, or future. Also the current day is displayed at the time of the planner.
